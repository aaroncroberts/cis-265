# Overview

Sample programs are available that illustrate java language patterns and concepts.  These were written in parallel to the textbook for the course as I progressed through the book.  Often, work expanded on the program examples from the book as I explored the language. 

Source code is available in the respsitory under the `/src` folder.  After cloning the repo, navigate to the diretory to compile and work wth the samples.

Follow the [Setup](/programs/Setup) guide to be sure your workstation can run the samples.
