# Overview

Samples are available for reference.  In order to work with the samples, you will need to have Jave installed and configured correctly on your machine.  Directions for installing [open-jdk-8](https://openjdk.org/install/) can be found online.

## Source Code

Clone the respository to run the samples. All source code is located in the `/src` folder.
Programs can be compiled and run from the terminal using the javac command.

Example compile and run:

````
    javac Welcome.java
    java Welcome
````

Several programs allow input from the command line.  Input should be entered in the same terminal where the program is started.

## VSCode

Extensions are setup in the vscode settings file in this repository to allow debuging and working with Java.  Recommended extensions are available in the `.vscode` folder at the root.
