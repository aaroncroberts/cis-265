# About this Site

This site is a repository of learning material developed as part of my course work in CIS 265.  The site is created by using Hugo to generate static websites from markdown.  The paterns used in this site were collected by researching material online about content management, static sites, and markdow files.

That lead me to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  This is a system written in Go, using Dass and scss, has a large community, extensive biuld process, and vast theme templates.
